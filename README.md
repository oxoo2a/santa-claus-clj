# santa-claus

Clojure implementation of the well-known synchronization problem called "Santa Claus" with 9 reindeer, 13 elves, and of course Santa Claus himself. Since refs, agent, and atoms don't block explicitly thanks to software transactional memory, this implementation uses cora.async threads and channels.

### Bugs

The following issues exist:
- If there is a high frequency of elf requests, more than a maximum of 3 elves get help. There is another queue missing that throttles the elves.
- Symbols in core.async can't be refered direclty.
- Thread clean-up at program end is not working yet.
- Currently, keyword maps are used to represent abstractions such as the barrier inside the program. There might be better ways to do this.
